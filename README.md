# Employee-Satishfication-Survey-Web-App-Using-Django
To develop a user-friendly, interactive web app for conducting employee satisfaction surveys in organizations using Django, a Python-based web framework.

Background: Employee satisfaction plays a crucial role in the overall success of an organization. It is essential to gauge the level of satisfaction amongst employees to improve the work environment, boost morale, and enhance productivity. A web-based survey application can help organizations conduct surveys efficiently, analyze data, and make informed decisions.

Project Description:

The Employee Satisfaction Survey Web App will be a Django-based application that allows organizations to create, distribute, and analyze employee satisfaction surveys. The application will consist of the following components:

User Authentication: Allow users to register and log in to the platform. Implement role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee). Survey Creation: Enable authorized users (Admins and Managers) to create surveys with customizable questions (e.g., multiple-choice, rating scales, open-ended). Allow users to set survey start and end dates. Survey Distribution: Send survey links to employees via email. Enable employees to access surveys using unique, secure links. Ensure survey responses are anonymous. Survey Response Collection: Provide an intuitive user interface for employees to complete the survey. Implement responsive design for optimal user experience on various devices. Validate and store survey responses in a database.
